# openai-gym

An exploration of OpenAI's Gym environments.

### Environments

Solutions (complete or not) for the various Gym environments are in the [Environments Folder](https://github.com/SealedSaint/openai-gym/tree/master/Environments).

### The Tools

I have attempted to solve these problems using my own home-grown neural network solution.

The idea is to model the behavior of biological neurons. More on this can be found [here](https://github.com/SealedSaint/Brain).

*Disclaimer: I started this neural net approach with zero knowledge of neural networks. I only had what I learned in Anatomy class.*
